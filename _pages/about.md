## About Me

I bring a systems-engineering mindset to robotics, bridging mechatronic system design, control theory, and software implementation. My work focuses on translating research innovations into practical, experimentally validated solutions for real-world robotic systems.

**Core Strengths**

- **End-to-end robotic system development** — mechanical design → control algorithms → experimental validation  
- **Motion control & real-time systems** — servo tuning, trajectory optimization, and embedded control implementation  
- **Cable-driven and compliant actuation** — wearable robotics and human-interaction systems  
- **Physics-informed machine learning** — data-efficient estimation and hybrid modeling  
- **Full-stack technical execution** — MATLAB/Simulink, Python/C++, and firmware-level development  
- **Technical leadership** — mentoring students and contributing to collaborative, cross-functional projects
