## About Me

I bring a systems engineering mindset to robotics, bridging mechanical design, control theory, and software implementation. My work focuses on translating research innovation into practical, experimentally validated solutions for real-world robotic systems.

**Core Strengths:**

- **End-to-end robotic system development** — mechanical design → control algorithms → experimental validation
- **Motion control & real-time systems** — servo tuning, trajectory optimization, and embedded control implementation
- **Specialized in cable-driven actuators** — wearable robotics and compliant actuation systems
- **Physics-informed machine learning** — data-efficient estimation and model-based control
- **Full-stack technical skills** — MATLAB/Simulink, Python/C++, firmware-level programming
- **Research leadership** — mentoring students, collaborative projects, and cross-functional teamwork
