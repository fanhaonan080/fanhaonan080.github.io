# Robotics & Control Engineer

I design and deploy robotic systems — from mechanical architecture and actuator design to real-time control and physics-informed estimation.

Currently seeking robotics/control engineering roles in robotic systems.

## About Me
I am a robotics engineer with a systems-level approach to building intelligent machines. My work spans mechanical design, control architecture, embedded implementation, and experimental validation — translating theory into reliable, real-world robotic systems.

I specialize in mechatronic systems, actuator design, control implementation, dynamic system modelling, and physics-constrained estimation frameworks for wearable and networked robotic systems.


**Core Strengths**

- **End-to-end robotic system development** — concept → mechanical design → control implementation → experimental validation  
- **Real-time motion control systems** — servo tuning, disturbance rejection, trajectory generation, embedded control  
- **Physics-informed machine learning** — data-efficient estimation and hybrid modeling for deployable robotics
- **Full-stack implementation** — MATLAB/Simulink, SolidWorks, Altium Designer, Python, C++, and firmware-level development  
- **Technical leadership & mentoring** — cross-disciplinary collaboration and project guidance
