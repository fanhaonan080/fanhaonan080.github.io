## Hobbies & Sports

### Woodworking

I enjoy hands-on craftsmanship and building functional pieces. Working with scrap wood has become a cost-effective and creative outlet alongside research and engineering work. Woodworking reinforces patience, precision, and problem-solving, and it also supports my other hobbies by enabling me to build custom fixtures and tools.

### Photography & Travel

I’ve been interested in photography for many years and eventually realized that I’m more drawn to the buttons and controls than the artistic process itself. I often use photography to document travel and everyday life.


### Skiing

It’s not just about speed. it’s about technique, maneuverability, self-progression, and (of course) appreciating the mother nature. I’m obsessed with downhill skiing, have tried cross-country skiing, and am currently learning snowboarding. Give me nice groomers and I’ll leave behind some perfectly engineered S-turns.


### Tennis & Basketball & Cycling

I enjoy competitive sports that balance physical challenge, strategy, and teamwork. Tennis is now my daily go-to, while I previously served as a team lead in college basketball during my undergraduate years. In warmer months, long-distance group riding becomes one of my favorite weekend resets.

## Other Pursuits

### Leaderships
I’ve consistently taken on leadership roles, including class monitor, basketball team lead, and research project lead. I served as a class monitor in both high school and undergraduate studies, led a college basketball team, and currently lead multiple research projects. I enjoy helping teams move forward and supporting others’ growth, focusing on getting things done rather than holding a title.


### Continuous Learning
I see life as an ongoing process of exploration and learning. Picking up new skills, ideas, and perspectives expands how I think and work. I try not to delay growth by avoiding unknows. Curiosity has always paid off.
