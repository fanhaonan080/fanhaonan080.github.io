This project focuses on the mechanical design and optimization of a compact ankle exoskeleton structure. The objective is to maintain alignment between the device rotation center and the human ankle joint while minimizing overall device size and weight.

The system is **currently under development** and will be integrated with the cable-driven actuator platform. Design details will be published upon completion of the study.

## Design Objective

Ankle exoskeletons must:
- Preserve joint alignment during motion
- Minimize device structural footprint and weight
- Ensure compatibility with footwear and walking gait

The challenge is to satisfy joint-alignment constraints while minimizing overall mechanism size.

## Technical Approach

We developed a parametric linkage model and derived the full kinematic relationships in MATLAB. To determine the optimal configuration, I designed an optimization framework that:
- Minimizes deviation between linkage rotation center and anatomical ankle center
- Penalizes excessive structural dimensions
- Evaluates feasibility across the gait range of motion

The resulting configurations were prototyped using 3D printing and iteratively tested for fit and alignment.

## Current Status

- Kinematic model derived and validated in MATLAB  
- Optimization-based configuration selection implemented  
- Multiple 3D-printed prototypes evaluated for fit  
- Integration with actuator platform in progress
