## Cable-Driven Actuator with Programmable Elasticity
I designed and experimentally validated a **cable-driven actuator** for human–robot interaction, focusing on **eliminating cable slack**, **stable force control**, and **programmable compliance** under dynamic loading. The actuator was developed for wearable robotics and human-subject experiments, where safety and robustness are critical.

**Problem:** 
While cable-driven actuation enables lightweight and flexible force transmission, practical systems often suffer from:
- Cable slack and backlash  
- Nonlinear force transmission  
- Limited force control bandwidth  
- Safety constraints in human interaction  

The goal was to build a compact actuator that maintains tension stability, responds quickly to disturbances, and supports tunable compliance.
 

**My Role:**
I led this project end-to-end, including:
- Mechanical and actuator design  
- Physics-based modeling and control design  
- Embedded system integration  
- Benchtop experimental validation  


**Technical Highlights:**
- Designed a **unidirectional cable-driven actuator** to eliminate slack  
- Integrated a **programmable elastic element** for variable stiffness behavior  
- Developed and tuned control strategies for fast force regulation and disturbance rejection  
- Prioritized experimental robustness over idealized performance  

**Experimental Validation:**
The actuator was validated through benchtop experiments including:
- Force tracking under dynamic references  
- Disturbance rejection with increasing frequency and amplitude  
- Stability testing across stiffness configurations  

**Key outcomes:**
- Stable force control with settling times below 0.1 s  
- Reliable tension regulation without cable slack  
- Graceful performance degradation under aggressive disturbances  

The actuator was subsequently used in pilot human-interaction studies.

**Impact:**
- Delivered a practical solution to cable slack and compliance trade-offs  
- Enabled safe and stable force control for wearable robotics experiments  
- Served as a reusable actuator platform for multiple studies  
- Resulted in a peer-reviewed journal manuscript (under review) 

**Skills Demonstrated:**
Actuator design • Nonlinear modeling and control • Real-time control implementation • Hardware–software integration • Experimental validation
