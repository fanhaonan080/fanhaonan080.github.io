### [Cable-Driven Actuator for Exoskeletons and HumanRobot Interaction](/projects/cable-actuator/)

Developed a cable-driven actuator with programmable compliance for wearable robotics, achieving continuous tension control and force output up to 200 N for human perturbation studies.

**Key Contributions:**
- Force-control architecture with sub-100ms settling time
- Elimination of cable slack through continuous tension regulation
- Integration with exoskeleton systems for balance perturbation experiments
