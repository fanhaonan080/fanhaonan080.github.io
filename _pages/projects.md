## Cable-Driven Actuator with Programmable Elasticity

I led the system-level development and experimental validation of a **cable-driven actuator** for human–robot interaction, focusing on **eliminating cable slack**, **stable force control**, and **programmable compliance**. The platform supports wearable robotics and human-subject experiments where safety and responsiveness are critical.

### Problem

Cable-driven systems are lightweight but prone to:

- Cable slack and backlash  
- Nonlinear force transmission  
- Limited force-control bandwidth under dynamic loading  
- Safety constraints in human interaction  

The goal was to build a compact actuator capable of stable tension regulation and high-speed perturbations.

---

### My Role

The initial mechanical prototype was developed by a master’s student. I led the system refinement and evolution of the actuator, including:

- Formalizing the mathematical modeling of cable transmission and elastic behavior  
- Designing and implementing the full force-control architecture  
- Developing the actuator control codebase  
- Integrating the Moteus motor controller for real-time regulation  

I later led a second iteration optimized for ankle perturbation experiments, including TTL-triggered control via DAQ and high-force validation up to **150 N**.

### Experimental Validation

The actuator was validated through benchtop experiments including:

- Dynamic force tracking  
- Frequency-based disturbance rejection  
- Stability testing across stiffness configurations

**Key Results:**

- Settling times below 0.1 s  
- Stable tension regulation without slack  
- Reliable performance up to 150 N  
- Robust synchronization for perturbation studies

### Human Perturbation Study

The actuator was further evaluated in a pilot walking experiment, where cable perturbations were applied to the foot during gait.

### Impact

- Transformed an initial prototype into a robust, experiment-ready actuator platform  
- Enabled safe and repeatable force perturbation experiments  
- Currently being integrated into additional exoskeleton systems  
- Resulted in a peer-reviewed journal manuscript (under review)  

**Skills:** Actuator refinement • Force control • Embedded integration • Real-time triggering • High-load experimental validation
