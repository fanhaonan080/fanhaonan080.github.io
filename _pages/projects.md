## Side Project

### 3D-Printed Tennis Phone Mount
This project started when I became slightly obsessed with improving my tennis technique. I wanted to record my strokes during practice so I could review my movement patterns and make adjustments. The problem: I either needed a very patient cameraman, or a mount that could capture my full-body motion as I moved across the court. I found a few designs that hang on the net, but most of them only support vertical phone orientation. Great for social media clips. Not ideal for analyzing footwork, spacing, and full-court movement. So I designed my own.

The whole searching and CAD was done under 30 minutes while I was waiting for my friend. This phone mount hangs directly on the tennis net and supports horizontal (landscape) phone placement on both sides, allowing full-court recording during practice sessions.

**Key Features**
- Parametric CAD model in SolidWorks  
- Dual landscape slots for stroke and footwork analysis  
- Net-hanging geometry for fast setup and removal  
- 3D-printed and field-tested during live practice
