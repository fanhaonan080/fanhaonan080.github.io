## Side Project

### 3D-Printed Tennis Phone Mount
This project started when I got seriously interested in improving my tennis technique. Recording full-court motion was hard without a dedicated cameraman, and most net holders only support vertical phone orientation.

One day while waiting for a friend, the idea hit me.

Built in under **30 minutes** from searching to the CAD model, this lightweight mount hangs on the tennis net and supports **horizontal (landscape) phone placement on both sides**, allowing full-court video collection during practice.

**Key Skills:**  
Rapid prototyping • User-centered design • 3D printing

</div>


**Key Features:**
- Parametric CAD model in SolidWorks
- Dual landscape cellphone slots
- Net-hanging geometry for fast setup and removal
- 3D-printed and field-tested

A reminder that good engineering ideas often strike during the downtime between reps.
