## Cable-Driven Actuator for Exoskeletons and Human–Robot Interaction
I led the system refinement, control development, and experimental validation of a **cable-driven actuator** with programmable compliance for human–robot interaction. The actuator was designed to eliminate cable slack and enable stable, high-bandwidth force control for wearable robotics and human-subject experiments where safety and responsiveness are critical.

### Problem
Cable-driven systems are lightweight but prone to slack, nonlinear force transmission, and limited control bandwidth under dynamic loading. Slack introduces impact during re-engagement and loss of output position tracking.

The goal was to develop a compact, lightweight actuator that preserves continuous cable engagement through low-tension regulation, while enabling disturbance rejection in low-force mode and smooth, stable transition to high-force operation.

### My Role
I led the actuator’s system refinement and control development, including modeling cable transmission and elastic behavior, designing the force-control architecture, and implementing the full codebase with Moteus motor controller integration.

I developed a faster iteration for foot-placement perturbation studies and built a human torso perturbation setup (validated up to **150 N**) using TTL-triggered control via DAQ.

In parallel, I modified the Moteus firmware to enable IMU acquisition, allowing the controller to function as a centralized data hub for the exoskeleton system.

### Experimental Validation
The actuator was validated through benchtop experiments including:
- Dynamic force tracking  
- Frequency-based disturbance rejection  
- Stability testing across stiffness configurations

**Key Results:**
- Force control settling times below 0.1 s  
- Stable tension regulation without slack  
- Validated operation up to 200 N  
- Reliable synchronization for perturbation experiments  

### Human Perturbation Study
The actuator was further tested in a pilot walking experiment, where controlled cable perturbations were applied to the foot during gait.

### Impact
- Evolved an initial prototype into a robust, experiment-ready actuator platform  
- Enabled safe and repeatable perturbation-based human studies  
- Designed for reuse and integration into additional exoskeleton systems  
- Resulted in a peer-reviewed journal manuscript (under review)
