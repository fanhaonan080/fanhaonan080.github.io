## Overview
Designed and implemented an advanced motor control system that handles unintentional delays in feedback measurements.

## Key Technologies
- Embedded Systems (Arduino/STM32)
- Real-time Control
- MATLAB/Simulink
- Hardware Integration

## Achievements
- Achieved robust velocity control under delays
- Reduced noise without filters using delay-based control
- Validated through hardware experiments
